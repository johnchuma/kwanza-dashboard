          </h1>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <p>
              While Kwanza collects certain categories of personal data in the
              course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, we do not
              intentionally collect data that reveals your real-world identity,
              such as your name, address, phone number, or any government
              identifiers such as your Social Security Number. Instead, Kwanza
              collects certain data about your computer or device through the
              use of cookies and other similar technologies, as explained below.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may assign a unique identifier or ID to your browser, mobile
              device, or connected television when we serve an ad to it or you
              use it to access a client’s digital properties, including their
              websites, emails, apps, and websites, emails, and apps where their
              ads appear (“Digital Properties”). The unique ID enables Kwanza to
              determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer
              or device is the same as one previously interacted with. In some
              cases, based on third-party data, we are able to infer within a
              reasonable probability that a particular computer or device should
              be associated with the same unique ID. Also, our partners may
              provide us with associations that they have made based on data
              they collect from you. Where we are able to make such inferences,
              we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across
              multiple computers or devices. This is sometimes referred to as
              cross-device advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              The unique ID can be a cookie ID (a unique ID assigned randomly by
              Kwanza to an unrecognized browser), a mobile advertising ID (a
              unique ID assigned by the mobile operating system, e.g., Apple ID
              for Advertising or Android Advertising ID), an OTT TV Device
              Identifier for Advertising (a unique ID assigned by an OTT TV
              provider, e.g., Roku ID for Advertising), or a statistical ID
              (created by Kwanza). We use information about your computer or
              device to generate the statistical ID, including your operating
              system, user-agent string, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
              installed fonts, and similar information. This information makes
              your computer or device distinct enough for our systems to
              determine within a reasonable probability that they are
              encountering the same computer or device over time, including in
              environments where Kwanza cookies are not supported.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your unique ID is associated with other categories of personal
              data that we collect about you. These categories include the
              following:

                We refer to this data as Bid Request Data and Impression Data,
                and we receive this data from media supply sources, such as
                publishers (i.e., organizations who operate Digital Properties)
                and exchanges or supply-side platforms who display ads on
                publishers' Digital Properties. This data includes: your
                imprecise location (e.g., country, region, postal code), browser
                type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system
                (e.g., Mac OS or Windows); browser language (e.g., English or
                Spanish); IP address; Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast
                or Verizon); and either a Kwanza ID or an ID that one of our
                partners may assign to your browser or device, which we may
                associate with the Kwanza ID that we assigned to your browser or
                device. It also may include Precise Location Data, such as
                GPS-level latitude-longitude coordinates or location-based radio
                frequency signal triangulation. When we process Precise Location
                Data, the mobile app publisher or other media supply source is
                responsible for enabling you to provide or withdraw consent with
                respect to the collection and use of your Precise Location Data.
                Please check the settings of the mobile app and your device if
                you would like to change your preferences in relation to Precise
                Location Data.

                <strong>Pixel Data and Other Client Data:</strong> Kwanza
                clients may use the Platform to collect data regarding your
                interactions with them when you visit their Digital Properties.
                We also may collect the same data when you visit the Website.
                This includes information such as the time you visited the site,
                the page URL, your IP address, your browser type (e.g., Chrome
                or Internet Explorer), the operating system (e.g., Mac OS or
                Windows), the type of device you use (e.g. laptop or desktop),
                and data regarding your activities on the Digital Properties.
                For example, if you are shopping for a product online, place a
                product in your online shopping cart, or make an online
                purchase, the client associated with the website or app may use
                the Platform to collect that data and later show you an ad on a
                different site or app related to that product. Kwanza clients
                also may use the Platform to collect hashed personal data that
                (if unhashed) would reveal your real-world identity, such as
                hashed email addresses. We refer to everything described above
                as Pixel Data. Clients also may import data that they have
                obtained outside the Platform, such as segments that our clients
                create or obtain independently from other third-party sources. A
                segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes
                (e.g., “car enthusiast”). Clients also may import data that they
                may possess or independently obtain offline, such as data
                regarding a purchase you made in the client’s store. The
                client’s offline data is first processed by a third party, which
                removes any data that reveals your real-world identity, appends
                a Kwanza ID, and transmits the file to Kwanza for processing. We
                refer to this data as Other Client Data.

            Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
          </h2>
          <p>
            Kwanza uses proprietary algorithms to make decisions about whether
            or not to bid on opportunities to serve you ads and, if so, how much
            to bid. The ads you see are the result of client campaigns that
            specify how much to spend and on what basis to spend combined with
            the use of our algorithms. The ways in which we use algorithms to
            determine bid prices may be considered automated decision-making in
            certain jurisdictions. Additionally, these processes, in combination
            with client campaigns described below, may constitute profiling in
            certain jurisdictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As explained above, we assign a unique ID to your browser or device.
            Using proprietary technology, we associate data that we collect
            about you with this unique ID and create segments using inferred
            details about certain of your preferences, behaviors, and
            demographic information. Many of our clients’ campaigns rely on such
            segments. If Kwanza receives an opportunity to show you an ad on a
            publisher’s website or in a publisher’s app, that client may be one
            of the many who are eligible to bid to serve an ad to you.

            The automated processes that we use do not affect your legal rights

            with others) or your ability to receive social benefits or obtain
            citizenship, nor do they have legal effects on you. Also, we do not
            knowingly process or make automated decisions about EEA users based
            on any data that falls into special categories in the EEA. As
            described below, you have the right to object to this automated
            processing at any time and you may have additional rights.

            third party's, such as our clients’) legitimate interests and not
            overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt out. If we
            collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate
            interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally
            be to operate the Platform and serve you ads on behalf of our
            clients. We may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate,
            we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate

            If you want to limit the data Kwanza collects and processes about

            to your browsers or devices, you may opt out from Kwanza tracking
            and interest-based advertising at any time. If you opt out, you will
            still see ads, but those ads are not likely to have anything to do
            with products or services you care about. With interest-based
            advertising, you receive ads and offers that are more likely to be
            useful to you.

            Kwanza collects and processes and do not wish to receive Kwanza

            and process data from your device only as needed to honor your
            choice and for limited research and development purposes to improve
            our device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our
            ability to honor your choice. Where Kwanza receives a signal to

            We require third parties to respect the security of your personal

            define the permissible scope and, where appropriate, restrict the
            use by third parties of your personal data. We require our third
            parties who provide us services to only use the information that we
            provide to them in connection with the services they perform for us
            and in accordance with our instructions.

            We also may publish or otherwise make public anonymous, aggregate,
            or summary information regarding campaigns run on behalf of our

            aggregated statistics regarding seasonal trends in shopping patterns
            or geographic differences in advertising impression opportunities.

          </h1>

            Kwanza implements appropriate technical and organizational measures
            to safeguard personal data in our possession against being
            accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered
            or disclosed. No transmission of data over the Internet, however, is
            guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third
            parties not under the control of Kwanza to intercept or access
            transmissions or communications unlawfully. While we strive to
            protect your personal data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
            of any data you transmit to us or that we collect about you. We have
            procedures in place to address any suspected personal data breach,
            and if we are required by law, we will notify you of any such
            breach.

          <p>
            Kwanza processes information in a way that is compatible with and
            relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent
            necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure
            that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current, and
            reliable for its intended use. If you have any questions about
            security on the Website or through the Platform, you can contact us

            As described above, we process your personal data for different
            purposes, and the length of time that we retain your personal data
            varies depending on the processing purpose, the category of personal
            data, and certain external factors.

            We will retain the Kwanza ID and, where applicable, its association
            with other devices for up to twenty-four months.

            months, and we retain much of this data for shorter periods of time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, we may delete personal data in response to a request from a
            user under applicable law or when contracts with our clients end.
            Most cookies set via the Platform expire within thirteen months,
